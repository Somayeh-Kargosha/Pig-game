# Pig Game

Pig Game is a simple dice game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It's a turn-based two-player game where the players take turns rolling a dice. The goal is to reach a certain score first, typically 100 points.


## Features

- Two players can play the game.
- Players can roll the dice as many times as they want during their turn.
- The current player's score is accumulated as long as they keep rolling and don't roll a 1.
- Players can choose to hold their current score, which adds it to their total score.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current score is lost, and it becomes the other player's turn.
- The first player to reach the specified winning score wins the game.

## Technologies Used
